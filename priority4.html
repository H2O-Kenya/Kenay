            The total cost to build the wells is estimated at $48,900,000. 
        </p> 
        <p>
            H2O for Kenya has offset its initial costs through donations, exemptions and partnerships. All 4,005 licenses were also waived by the Kenyan government along with a 25% tax exemption for all the various materials being imported saving $2,900,000 . Primo Water decided to donate all the water coolers. This reduced the cost by $100,000 for 10% equity. Beyonc√© has promised to cover 20% of the startup costs in exchange for 20% ownership, which is $9,180,000. Yet another investor will invest 10% of the costs to decrease costs by a total of $4,590,000 in return for 10% ownership.

           This will also include the long-term maintenance of the wells to make them last longer and serve effectively; the estimate includes annual well inspections at $375, yearly chlorinate shock treatments at $105 dollars, pump coping monthly at $20 and hydro bills at $20monthly. Wells are foreseen to be replaced every $75 years at the replacement cost of $46,400 per well. This amounts to 3,315 annually per well for maintenance.

            About 17 million people are facing a water crisis in Kenya today; some of them do not have access to safe drinking water. Using our projections, assuming each of these purchased at least 1 gallon of water, and assuming 25% of those purchase bottled gallons, we are projecting approximately $59,500,000  in annual revenue. For the first year, 2025, the deductions consist of 45% to stakeholders at -$26,775,000 , startup costs at -$36,230,000 , and annual maintenance costs at -$3,315 USD, adding up to a first-year loss of -$3,508,315 .

          Our estimates reveal that once we reach 2035 our company will be achieving an estimated profit of $323,708,535 which is after all expenses, meaning we grow consistently, remain profitable, and manage our operational costs correctly. Our estimates anticipate consistent revenue growth due to this, and the longer outlook conveys an organic growth, enabling the company to be profitable and stable for your financials for the future 10 years.
